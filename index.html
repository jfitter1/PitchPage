	<h1 class="container">Hi! I'm Jake</h1>
    <div class="container" class="bodycopy">I'm currently a senior Visual Communication Design student at Eastern Washington University. I enjoy making pretty pictures and solving problems. I wasn't born a designer, my first love was programming. I like to tell people I didn't find design, it found me. I enjoy sovling problems and finding creative ways to solve them and design gave me a new medium to do just that.I'v always been an outdoorsy guy and when I'm not spending hours choosing between 11pt and 10pt font I enjoy riding my bike with no destination in mind. Okay, that might not be entirely true. I mainly ride my bike to the local brewery and share my passion of drinking craft beer with other beer snobs like myself.
